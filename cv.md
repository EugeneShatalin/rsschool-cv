![](img/photo.jpg) JavaScript Developer| About me: At the moment I work as a communications engineer, and I have been familiar with programming for a long time. I have a specialized higher education. After graduating from the university, there was not opportunity to get a job as a programmer, since this area was not very developed in our country at that time. But all the time I tried to study something, wrote something in C ++, PHP, made simple sites for my acquaintances. Now I decided to finally become a developer, while I am intensively studying frontend and React.js. In the future, I will study Node.js and become a full-stack JavaScript developer.
